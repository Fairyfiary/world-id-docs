## What?

Using World ID, and particularly relying on global proof of personhood, can be used to build a truly democratic, one person one vote, system as well as novel voting systems centered around unique humans. What’s more, with World ID, these systems can be made in a fully privacy-preserving way, supporting fully anonymous voting, and making sure votes cannot be tracked across different proposals.

## Applications & Problems Solved

**Novel DAOs** (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) governance. Have governance proposals where individual’s voices are more important than the number of tokens held.

**Anonymous online polls.** This can apply for anything from city council elections, governors to referendums, plebiscites, and much more.

**Government** Public elections without duplicate votes, where each voter can only vote once. Further, this can be done in a public way where anyone can verify each election vote. This can apply for anything from city council elections, governors to referendums, plebiscites, and much more.


## The MVP

The most basic version of a voting platform could look something like this.

Users can create proposals to vote on. They provide a description on the proposal and a time limit. Proposals support yes/no/abstain.

Voters can then go into a proposal and cast a vote only once. The vote is verified with a World ID anonymous action (to ensure proof of personhood, uniqueness, and prevent cross-proposals tracking).

Votes are recorded in a backend, smart contract or decentralized database (like Ceramic).

Anyone can view the vote results.
